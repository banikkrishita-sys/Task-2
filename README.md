This project presents an interactive Business Sales Dashboard developed using Power BI to analyze overall sales performance.
The dashboard highlights key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Delivery Success Rate, and Average Rating. 
It includes visualizations for quarterly sales trends, category-wise performance, payment method distribution, state-wise sales analysis, and top-performing products.
An additional Insights page summarizes key findings and provides business recommendations based on the data. 
The objective of this dashboard is to support data-driven decision-making by identifying sales patterns, customer preferences, and improvement opportunities.
